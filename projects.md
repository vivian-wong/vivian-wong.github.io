Most of these projects can be found also on my [CV](https://vivian-wong.github.io/cv.pdf). This page only provides a brief description and (mostly) directs to links that provide more information. 

### Building Detection from Satellite Imagery
#### March - June 2018, Stanford, CA
View our project report [**here**](https://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_spring_2018/reports/8290424.pdf).

### Global Architecture/Engineering/Construction (AEC) Project 
#### January - June 2018, Stanford, CA
In this class project, I designed the structural system for a green building on a (imaginary) site in Germany with a team of students in various disciplines. Every detail of the project is just too gory to be shown here. But if you have to look, you can find it [**here**](http://pbl.stanford.edu/AEC%20projects/projpage.htm). Look for project River 2017-2018. 

### Wheelchair Rider Simulation
#### January - March 2018, Stanford, CA
I am honored to have done an independent study with [Professor Law](https://cee.stanford.edu/people/kincho-law) and [Dr. Fruchter](https://cee.stanford.edu/people/renate-fruchter) on the simulation of a wheelchair rider. View a [**demo video**](https://youtu.be/eLto7yCQUto) of a wheelchair rider, who moves around the building we rendered in the AEC project mentioned above. This simulation was built upon an existing software, [Terf](https://www.3dicc.com/).

### Citizen Engagement Using Augmented Reality & Wearable Technology
#### December 20178, Stanford, CA
This is a short independent study I did on Defining Smart Cities Seminar (CEE225). 
View my presentation on Human Cities Expo 2017 [**here**](https://vimeo.com/248506752)

### Software & Hardware Development for Quanser Shake Table II ï»¿
#### September 2015 - May 20178, Urbana, IL
I was lucky to have done an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) project with [Professor Spencer](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/bfs) at his [SSTL Lab](http://sstl.cee.illinois.edu/).
