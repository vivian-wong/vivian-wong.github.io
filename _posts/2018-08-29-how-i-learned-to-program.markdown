title: How I Learned to Program

Right now I'm running a deep RL network on my laptop and have not much to do other than waiting for it to train itself. 
Therefore, I decided to take this time to write about the journey I took to learn to program. The journey is definitely still ongoing since 
I'm still learning more and more programming everyday in work and school, but before I forget, I would like to write it down and remind myself 
what I've gone through and how much I love it. This article probably relates to you more if you're one of those people like me who's (thinking of) starting 
to learn programming half-way through starting your non-CS major, and you start to wonder if you're too late or you start to feel the impending hardship. 

I know a lot of people started learning programming in high school, middle school or even elementary school (either self-taught or taking classes). 
Believe me, 2 days ago I heard my supervisor saying that there are classes now that teach kids how to program in grade 1. I didn't quite realize 
what programming is until I took Introduction to Computing for Engineering and Science (CS101) in the second semester of my freshman year as a civil engineering major. That class 
was really a lot of fun. I learned Matlab at first and then C. I just loved the feeling of creating something that is kind of like a product, and 
when it finally runs, there is so much of a sense of accomplishment. I also loved writing and debugging logical statements, which made me feel like a puzzle solver. 
I know it sounds nerdy, but I regret not taking it sooner and going down the path of taking a computer science minor.  

My decision of not pursuing the minor was because taking CS125 (which is the first class of a CS minor) was kind of an inefficient way of taking classes. 
CS125 could replace CS101 in the Civil Engineering curriculum (I learned that after I finished CS101), but it doesn't work the other way around. 
I wanted to finish all my required classes in 3 years so much that I felt like taking CS125 would be wasteful.  

My next moment of lots of coding came pretty soon. During my sophomore year, I worked in Prof. Spencer's lab on a shake table (a table that shakes, duh!). 
I was coding on Matlab and LabVIEW to implement all kinds of software functions. And then there was also hardware connection problems with the table. 
I spent tons of time looking for which cable is supposed to connect to which port, and then back on the computer to code and test my functions. 
It was definitely difficult, but fun! Especially when I had a super nice mentor, Martha, who taught me how to do more advanced coding on Matlab 
(it was like some state space stuff that I later saw a bit in Structural Dynamics, and feedback control loops). As a bonus, I also went to a LabVIEW workshop to 
get certified as a LabVIEW Developer! I was quite pumped and knew I loved solving logical problems. But I was soon stepping into my 3rd year in college, 
which is also my last year according to my plan to finish college early. So when summer started, all of my mind was on preparing grad school applications. 
I wanted to get the top-tier schools, and so applying to programs that I had the most background in would be the safest. That of course led to almost 
all my applications being sent towards structural engineering programs. I had renowned recommenders in that field and decent grades in structures classes. 

And then there was Stanford, with all the famous professors and world-class CS classes that I didn't know before I came... It had a strong civil engineering department, 
of course, but soon I realized most of my peers were taking CS classes and the professor I wanted to work with also mentioned that taking CS classes would be beneficial 
for research. I kind of learned that too late, though. I ended up finishing off most structural engineering courses in the first 2 quarters, then 
took a class on Programming Abstractions (CS106B) and Intro to Deep Learning (CS230) in the Spring quarter. CS106B was super fun with a professor who 
was able to explain concepts very clearly.
